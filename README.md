project 2 documentation
Client Summary:
Artemis Financial was our client, a consulting company specializing in financial accounts for their customers. They provide a range of financial planning services. Artemis Financial engaged us to enhance the security of their web application, primarily to secure data during its transmission.

Identifying Security Vulnerabilities:
During the assessment, I effectively identified vulnerabilities within Artemis Financial's security. In the process of rectifying these vulnerabilities, I focused on writing clean and secure code. This proactive approach helped mitigate potential security issues that might have arisen due to unsecure code. It's crucial to code securely because unsecure code may lead to unforeseen consequences, potentially providing malicious actors with opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities, ultimately risking data breaches. The damage resulting from data breaches, especially concerning personal information, can be immense, affecting clients' personal lives and eroding trust in the company. Therefore, software security adds substantial value to a company as it safeguards its assets, customers, and reputation.

Challenges in Architecture Review:
I initially encountered challenges when analyzing the application's architecture (Architecture Review). Secure coding principles weren't immediately clear to me, making it difficult to analyze the program effectively. This necessitated hours of studying secure code examples to grasp how best practices could be pragmatically applied to a project.

Increasing Layers of Security:
To enhance the security of Artemis Financial's program, we implemented SHA-256 encryption, ensuring data security through hash functions during data transfers. We also transitioned from HTTP to HTTPS, signaling to browsers that data exchanges must occur over encrypted channels. In the future, cryptographic algorithms will be a fundamental component of my approach, helping encrypt and decrypt data efficiently.

Ensuring Code and Application Security:
To confirm the code and application's security, we performed comprehensive testing, including functional testing and security testing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. After refactoring the code, we conducted regression testing and extensive security scans to ascertain whether new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Resources and Tools:
Throughout this assignment, we employed an array of resources and tools such as security testing tools, documentation on secure coding practices, and development environments equipped with security features. These invaluable resources will undoubtedly prove beneficial in future assignments, ensuring that security remains a central focus.

Examples for Future Employers:
From this assignment, I can demonstrate my ability to identify and rectify software security vulnerabilities effectively, implement secure coding practices, and enhance the security posture of software applications. This project serves as an excellent representation of my skills and knowledge in maintaining data security and integrity, a crucial asset for future employers in the fields of software development and cybersecurity.
